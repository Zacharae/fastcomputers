<p>4 And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</p>
<p>5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</p>
<p>6 And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</p>
<p>7 And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</p>
<p>8 And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</p>
<p>9 Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</p>
<p>10 As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</p>
<p>11 Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</p>
<p>12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</p>
<p>13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</p>
<p>14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p>
