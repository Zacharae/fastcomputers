		<p>The Code of Hammurabi is one of the oldest known legal codes, dating back to ancient Babylon in 1754 BCE. It is named after Hammurabi, the sixth king of Babylon, who ruled from 1792 BCE to 1750 BCE. The code consists of 282 laws that cover a wide range of topics, including property rights, trade, and family law. It is inscribed on a stele, a tall stone monument, and was discovered in 1901 in modern-day Iran.</p>
		<p>The Code of Hammurabi is significant because it represents one of the earliest attempts to create a set of laws and regulations that applied to all members of society. Prior to this, laws were typically determined by custom and tradition, and were enforced by individuals or groups within the community. Hammurabi's code established a centralized system of justice and created a standard set of punishments for various crimes. It also included provisions for the protection of the weak, such as widows and orphans, and established a minimum wage for workers.</p>
		<p>The code is written in cuneiform script, an early form of writing that used wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets. It has been translated into various languages and has influenced the development of legal systems throughout history. Although some of its laws are no longer applicable or relevant, the Code of Hammurabi remains a significant historical document and a testament to the enduring legacy of ancient Babylonian civilization.</p>
