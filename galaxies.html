            <h2>Types of Galaxies</h2>
            <p>Galaxies are classified into three main types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spiral galaxies:</strong> These have a spiral arm structure and a central bulge. Examples include the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.</li>
                <li><strong>Elliptical galaxies:</strong> These have a smooth, elliptical shape and no visible spiral arms. They range in size from small dwarf galaxies to massive giant galaxies.</li>
                <li><strong>Irregular galaxies:</strong> These have no distinct shape and are often chaotic in appearance. They are typically smaller than spiral and elliptical galaxies.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="features">
            <h2>Features of Galaxies</h2>
            <p>Galaxies have a variety of features that make them interesting to study:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Black holes:</strong> Many galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers, which can have a profound effect on the galaxy's structure and evolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Star formation:</strong> Galaxies are often sites of active star formation, with new stars being born out of clouds of gas and dust.</li>
                <li><strong>Dark matter:</strong> The vast majority of a galaxy's mass is thought to be composed of dark matter, an invisible substance that we can only detect through its gravitational effects on visible matter.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="discoveries">
            <h2>Galactic Discoveries</h2>
            <p>Over the years, astronomers have made many fascinating discoveries about galaxies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hubble's Law:</strong> In the 1920s, Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving away from us at a rate that is proportional to their distance from us. This led to the discovery of the expanding universe.</li>
                <li><strong>Galactic collisions:</strong> Many galaxies are currently colliding or merging with each other, which can trigger intense bursts of star formation and black hole activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Galactic cannibalism:</strong> Some galaxies are actually consuming smaller satellite galaxies, which can lead to the formation of new stars and the growth of the larger galaxy.</li>
            </ul>
