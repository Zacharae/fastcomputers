	<h1>Stan "The Man" Lee </h1>
<p>
	Stan Lee, born Stanley Martin Lieber, was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He was born on December 28, 1922, in Manhattan, New York City, and grew up during the Great Depression. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Romania, and his father was a dress cutter.

<p> </p>

As a child, Lee was an avid reader, especially of adventure and mystery novels. He also enjoyed listening to radio dramas and attending movies, which sparked his imagination and creativity. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and later went to City College of New York, where he studied English and writing.

<p> </p>

In 1939, Lee got his first job in the comic book industry as an assistant at Timely Comics, which would later become Marvel Comics. He started by running errands, filling inkwells, and proofreading, but eventually worked his way up to become an editor and writer. During World War II, Lee served in the US Army Signal Corps, where he wrote training manuals, cartoons, and slogans.

<p> </p>

In the early 1960s, Lee revolutionized the comic book industry by creating complex characters and storylines that dealt with social issues and personal struggles. He co-created many of Marvel's most popular characters, including Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Daredevil. His characters were often flawed and had relatable problems, which made them more appealing to readers.

<p> </p>

Lee's writing style was also innovative, as he added humor and witty dialogue to his stories, which had previously been mostly serious and straightforward. He also broke down the fourth wall, having characters address readers directly, which created a more intimate connection between the reader and the story.

<p> </p>

In addition to writing, Lee also served as editor-in-chief and later publisher of Marvel Comics. He oversaw the production of thousands of comic books and helped to create the Marvel Universe, a shared continuity where characters from different titles and storylines could interact with one another.

<p> </p>

Lee continued to work in the comic book industry well into his 80s, even after Marvel was bought by Disney in 2009. He made cameo appearances in many of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films and was known for his catchphrase "Excelsior!"

<p> </p>

Sadly, Lee passed away on November 12, 2018, at the age of 95, leaving behind a legacy of creativity and imagination that has inspired generations of readers and creators.
