	<h1>Spider-Man Backstory</h1>
	<p>Peter Benjamin Parker was orphaned as a child when his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash. He went to live with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May in Queens, New York City.</p>
	<p>Peter was an intelligent and hardworking student, but he was often bullied by his classmates. One day, he was bitten by a radioactive spider while on a field trip, which granted him spider-like abilities.</p>
	<p>Initially, Peter used his powers for personal gain, such as winning money in wrestling matches. However, after his Uncle Ben was murdered by a criminal he had allowed to escape, Peter realized the importance of using his powers responsibly to help others.</p>
	<p>Peter designed a costume and adopted the superhero identity of Spider-Man. He became a crimefighter in New York City, using his powers to stop various villains, including his arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin.</p>
	<p>Despite facing many challenges and personal tragedies, Spider-Man has remained a beloved hero and a symbol of hope for generations.</p>
