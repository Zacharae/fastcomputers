		<p>C-Squat is a squat located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York. It is located at 155 Avenue C, between East 9th and East 10th Streets. The building was originally built in the 1870s and was used as a public school until the 1960s.</p>

		<p>After the school closed down, the building was abandoned and left to decay for several years. In the 1980s, a group of activists and artists known as "The Real Estate Show" took over the building and turned it into a squat. They renamed the building C-Squat, after the letter "C" that appeared on the outside of the building.</p>
		<p>C-Squat became a hub for the underground punk and anarchist scene in New York City. Over the years, the building has been home to a variety of different groups, including squatters, activists, artists, and musicians. The building has also been the site of numerous protests and demonstrations.</p>
		<p>Today, C-Squat is still occupied by squatters, who continue to maintain the building and use it as a community center. The building is known for its distinctive graffiti and murals, which cover almost every surface of the building.</p>
