	<h1>C-3PO's Foibles and Follies</h1>
	<p>Despite being a protocol droid with a vast knowledge of languages and cultures, C-3PO often finds himself in comedic situations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Getting caught in a net on Endor</li>
		<li>Accidentally calling Chewbacca a "walking carpet"</li>
		<li>Having his head swapped with a battle droid during the Battle of Geonosis</li>
		<li>Getting his wires crossed and insulting Han Solo</li>
		<li>Mistaking Ewoks for deities and trying to worship them</li>
		<li>Being dismantled and mistaken for a pile of junk on Cloud City</li>
		<li>Accidentally activating a battle droid factory on Geonosis</li>
		<li>Constantly bickering with R2-D2</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Despite his mishaps, C-3PO remains a loyal and valuable member of the Rebel Alliance and a beloved character in the Star Wars universe.</p>
