<h1>Let My People Go</h1>
<p>"Let my people go" is a phrase from the Bible, specifically from the book of Exodus. The story tells how the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, and how God chose Moses to lead them out of slavery and into the promised land of Canaan.</p>
<p>Moses, in his role as a prophet and leader of the Israelites, demanded that Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, release the Israelites from slavery. He confronted Pharaoh several times with the demand "Let my people go," which became a powerful symbol of the Israelites' struggle for freedom.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, Pharaoh refused Moses' demands, and it took ten plagues sent by God before Pharaoh finally relented and allowed the Israelites to leave Egypt. These plagues were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Water turning into blood</li>
  <li>Frogs</li>
  <li>Lice</li>
  <li>Flies</li>
  <li>Pestilence</li>
  <li>Boils</li>
  <li>Hail</li>
  <li>Locusts</li>
  <li>Darkness</li>
  <li>Death of the firstborn</li>
</ol>
<p>This event is celebrated in the Jewish holiday of Passover, which commemorates the Israelites' liberation from slavery and their journey to the promised land. In addition to the liberation from slavery, the story of Exodus also includes the giving of the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai, which are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You shall have no other gods before me.</li>
  <li>You shall not make for yourself an idol.</li>
  <li>You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God.</li>
  <li>Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.</li>
  <li>Honor your father and mother.</li>
  <li>You shall not murder.</li>
  <li>You shall not commit adultery.</li>
  <li>You shall not steal.</li>
  <li>You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.</li>
  <li>You shall not covet.</li>
</ol>
