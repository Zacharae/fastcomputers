	<h1>Nutrition Study Sheet for NCLEX-RN</h1>
<h2>Macronutrients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Carbohydrates - primary source of energy; found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and sugars</li>
	<li>Proteins - building blocks of tissues and cells; found in meat, fish, poultry, beans, and nuts</li>
	<li>Fats - secondary source of energy; essential for hormone production, cell membrane structure, and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins; found in oils, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Micronutrients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Vitamins - essential for metabolism, growth, and development; found in fruits, vegetables, dairy, and fortified grains</li>
	<li>Minerals - essential for building strong bones, transmitting nerve impulses, and maintaining a healthy heart; found in dairy, leafy greens, and nuts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommended Daily Allowances (RDAs)</h2>
<p>The following are the recommended daily allowances for adults:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Nutrient</th>
		<th>RDA</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Calcium</td>
		<td>1,000-1,200 mg/day</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Iron</td>
		<td>18 mg/day for women; 8 mg/day for men</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Vitamin C</td>
		<td>75-90 mg/day</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Vitamin D</td>
		<td>600-800 IU/day</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2>Special Diets</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Diabetic diet - limits carbohydrate intake and emphasizes whole grains, fruits, and vegetables</li>
	<li>Low-fat diet - limits fat intake and emphasizes lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables</li>
	<li>Low-sodium diet - limits sodium intake and emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains</li>
	<li>Vegetarian diet - excludes meat, fish, and poultry; may include dairy and/or eggs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enteral Feeding</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Nasogastric (NG) tube - inserted through the nose and into the stomach; used for short-term feeding</li>
	<li>Gastrostomy (G) tube - inserted through an incision in the abdomen and into the stomach; used for long-term feeding</li>
	<li>Jejunostomy (J) tube - inserted through an incision in the abdomen and into the jejunum; used for patients with gastroparesis or those who cannot tolerate gastric feeding</li>
</ul>

<h2>Parenteral Nutrition</h2>
<p>Also known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), this method involves providing nutrition directly into the bloodstream through a central line. This is typically used for patients who cannot tolerate enteral feeding or who require a higher level of nutrition support.</p>

<h2>Assessment of Nutritional Status</h2>

<h2>Assessment of Nutritional Status</h2>
<p>Assessing a patient's nutritional status is important in identifying potential nutritional deficiencies or excesses, and in developing an appropriate plan of care. The following are some tools that can be used to assess a patient's nutritional status:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Anthropometric measurements - includes height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference</li>
	<li>Biochemical measurements - includes serum albumin, prealbumin, total protein, and electrolytes</li>
	<li>Clinical assessment - includes examination of the skin, hair, nails, and oral cavity; assessment of muscle and fat stores; and evaluation of physical signs of nutritional deficiencies or excesses</li>
	<li>Dietary assessment - includes a review of the patient's dietary intake, including portion sizes, frequency, and type of foods consumed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nutrition-Related Nursing Interventions</h2>
<p>The following are some nursing interventions related to nutrition:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Assist with meal planning and preparation</li>
	<li>Educate patients on healthy eating habits</li>
	<li>Monitor and document food and fluid intake</li>
	<li>Administer enteral or parenteral feedings, as ordered</li>
	<li>Monitor for signs and symptoms of malnutrition or overnutrition</li>
	<li>Collaborate with other healthcare professionals, such as registered dietitians, to develop an appropriate plan of care</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Nutrition is an important aspect of overall health and well-being, and nurses play a critical role in ensuring that patients receive adequate nutrition. Understanding the different types of nutrients, special diets, and methods of providing nutrition support, as well as the assessment of nutritional status and related nursing interventions, are all essential in providing high-quality patient care.</p>
