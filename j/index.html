Did ring and buzz with frabjous tones;
All mimsy were the call display,
And voicemails gyred in a wabe.

"Beware the robocalls, my friend!
The spam that spams, the telemarketer's end!
Beware the silence on the line,
And shun the scams that steal and swine!"
	</p>
	<p>

He took his cell phone in his hand,
Long time the nuisance foe he'd standâ€”
Then rested he by the do-not-call list,
And pondered awhile how he'd resist.
	</p>
	<p>

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with scammerhood,
Came whiffling through the caller ID,
And spamming as it came!
	</p>
	<p>

One, two! One, two! And through and through
The cell phone's battery life withdrew!
The man he fell, his phone aglow,
As the Jabberwocky scammer dealt his blow.
	</p>
	<p>

'Twas brillig, and the telephones
Did ring and buzz with frabjous tones;
All mimsy were the call display,
		And voicemails gyred in a wabe.</p>
