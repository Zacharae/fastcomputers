	<h1>Robin Williams in Jumanji</h1>
	<p>Robin Williams delivered a brilliant performance in the 1995 movie Jumanji, in which he played Alan Parrish, a man who had been trapped in a board game for 26 years.</p>
	<p>Williams' portrayal of Parrish was both heartwarming and hilarious, as he navigated his way through the dangers of the jungle and reconnected with his childhood friend, played by Bonnie Hunt.</p>
	<p>Jumanji remains a beloved classic to this day, and Robin Williams' performance is a big reason why.</p>
